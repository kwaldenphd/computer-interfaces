**Operating System**
- "An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs...For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware...Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer â€“ from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system))

Core OS tasks:
- Process management: allocates resources, executes programs, calls processes
- Memory management: allocates memory, controls memory hardware access
- File system management: interfaces with hardware to transmit, process, and store file system objects
- Device management: oversees system calls for efficient device management

Examples of specific operating systems include:
- Microsoft Windows
- MacOS/iOS
- Linux
- Android
- Chromium

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/computer-interfaces/blob/main/images/OS_Layers.png?raw=true" width="500"></p>

**The Kernel**
- core of the OS, controls access to computer hardware, performs scheduling tasks

**Device Drivers**
- software that allows the OS to interface with hardware (graphics cards, printers, network adapters, etc.)

**Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) & Application Software**
- software that allows the user to interact with the OS

**Virtual Memory**
- An approach to managing memory that provides "an idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually avaialble on a given machine" (Abhishek Bhattacharjee and Daniel Lustig, *[Architectural and Operating System Support for Virtual Memory](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-01757-5).* Springer, 2017. pp. 1)

# Working at the Command Line

*The Programming Historian* is a multi-language, peer-reviewed online resource with "novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate research and teaching" (["The Programming Historian"](https://programminghistorian.org/))
 
The sections of this lab that involve working at the command line are based on and adapts content from the following tutorials:
- Ian Milligan and James Baker, "Introduction to the Bash Command Line," The Programming Historian 3 (2014), https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0037.
- Miriam Posner, "[Getting Started With Unix](https://github.com/miriamposner/unix/blob/main/getting_started_with_commandline.md)" tutorial

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/computer-interfaces/blob/main/images/Mac_GUI.png?raw=true" width="500"></p>

The usual way that computer users today interact with their system is through a Graphical-User Interface, or GUI. This means that when you go into a folder, you click on a picture of a file folder; when you run a program, you click on it; and when you browse the web, you use your mouse to interact with various elements on a webpage. Before the rise of GUIs in the late 1980s, however, the primary way to interact with a computer was through a command-line interface (CLI).

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/computer-interfaces/blob/main/images/Shell.png?raw=true" width="500"></p>

Command-line interfaces allow for more detail when running some programs, because you can add modifiers to specify exactly how you want your program to run. They can be easily automated through scripts, which are essentially recipes of text-based commands.

There are two main command-line interfaces, or "shells." On Mac OS or many Linux installations, the shell is known as `bash`, or the â€˜Bourne-again shell.â€™ For users on Windows-based systems, the command-line interface is by default `MS-DOS-based`, which uses different commands and syntax, but can often achieve similar tasks. This tutorial provides a basic introduction to the `bash` terminal, and Windows users can follow along by installing popular shells such as Cygwin or Git Bash.

For Mac users (and most Linux installations), youâ€™re in luck â€” you already have a bash shell installed. 

Windows users will need to take one extra step and install Git Bash.

## Key Terms

**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
- "The graphical user interface (GUI) is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces (CLIs), which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface))

**Command Line Interface (CLI)**
- "A command-line interface (CLI) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor. Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface))

**Shell**
- The shell is the user interface for accessing all of the operating systemâ€™s services and applications. The shell is the layer of code surrounding the operating system kernel. Your operating systemâ€™s shell is the command processor that runs in the CLI (command-line interface) as opposed to the GUI interface that we typically use.

## Opening Your Shell

*NOTE: The following screenshots show the Mac OS terminal/shell. Folks with other operating systems should still be able to follow the procedural steps.*

<p align="center"><img align="center" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/computer-interfaces/blob/main/images/Fig_A1.png?raw=true" alt="Image of Mac Shell icon"></p>
 
To launch the terminal...

Mac:
- By default, the shell is located in `Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal`

Windows:
- Run Git Bash from the directory that you installed it in. You will have to run it as an administrator - to do so, right click on the program and select 'Run as Administrator.'

<p align="center"><img align="center" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/computer-interfaces/blob/main/images/Fig_A.png?raw=true" alt="Image of Mac Shell"></p>
 
When the terminal or shell is running, you will see a window that looks similar to the image above.

<p align="center"><img align="center" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/computer-interfaces/blob/main/images/Fig_B.png?raw=true" alt="Image of Mac terminal settings"></p>
 
For Mac users who want to customize the terminal's visual appearance:
- Open the `Settings` menu (in `Preferences`, under `Terminal`)
- Click the `Settings` tab to change the color scheme

Windows users can right-click on the application's top bar and select `Properties` to open the `Properties` tab.

## Terminal Wayfinding

<p align="center"><img align="center" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/computer-interfaces/blob/main/images/Fig_C.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Image of Mac shell"></p>

*NOTE: The following text and images are adapted from UCLA faculty member Miriam Posner's "[Getting Started With Unix](https://github.com/miriamposner/unix/blob/main/getting_started_with_commandline.md)" tutorial*

This is a terminal window, also called a `shell`. The active cursor showing up in the window is a `command prompt`. This is where you will type commands or instructions.

First, we can check your username using the `whoami` command. Type `whoami` in the shell and hit the `Enter` or `Return` key. The terminal returns your username, and the command prompt is ready for another command or instruction.

Let's try another command- this type, we'll use `echo` to repeat a set of characters in quotation marks. Type `echo 'Hello world!' into the terminal and hit the 'Enter' or 'Return' key. The `echo` command instructs the terminal to repeat whichever characters you include in the quotation marks.

## Typing Commands in the Terminal

You may have already noticed you're not able to navigate the terminal using your mouse or cursor. We can navigate the terminal using the keyboard. The `up` and `down` arrow keys let you move back (up) and forward (down) through previously typed commands. The `left` and `right` arrow keys let you move within characters or symbols for a specific command.

Press the `up` arrow once to show the previously-typed `echo` command. Then, use the `left` and `right` arrow keys to navigate to the characters within the quotation marks and replace them with another word or phrase of your choosing. Press `Return` or `Enter` to run the modified command. 

A couple other useful navigation tools:
- Press `Control` + `A` to move to the start of a line
- Press `Control` + `E` to move to the end of a line
- Type `clear` into the terminal and press `Return`/`Enter` to clear the screen
- When you're ready to close the terminal window, type `exit` and press `Return`/`Enter`

<p align="center"><img align="center" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/computer-interfaces/blob/main/images/Fig_D.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Diagram illustrating terminal syntax"></p>

A couple notes on terminal syntax:
- `commands` tell the computer to perform an action 
- `options` modify the command and use a hyphen (`-`) symbol
  * Sometimes `options` are called `flags` or `switches`
- `arguments` specify what the command operation will be performed on (i.e. a specific file or directory)

Not all commands require arguments or options, but some commands can have one or more of each. You can also chain multiple commands together using the vertical bar `|` symbol. This is often called a `pipe`.

### Navigating Your File System

#### Key Terms

**File Manager (or File Browser)**
- "A file manager or file browser is a computer program that provides a user interface to manage files and folders. The most common operations performed on files or groups of files include creating, opening (e.g. viewing, playing, editing or printing), renaming, copying, moving, deleting and searching for files, as well as modifying file attributes, properties and file permissions. Folders and files may be displayed in a hierarchical tree based on their directory structure" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager))
- Examples: Finder (Mac), File Explorer (Windows)

**File Extension (or Filename Extension)**
- "A filename extension, file name extension or file extension is a suffix to the name of a computer file (e.g., `.txt`, `.docx`, `.md`). The extension indicates a characteristic of the file contents or its intended use. A filename extension is typically delimited from the rest of the filename with a full stop (period)" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename_extension))

**Directory**
- "In computing, a directory is a file system cataloging structure which contains references to other computer files, and possibly other directories. On many computers, directories are known as folders" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)))

**Path**
- "A path is a string of characters used to uniquely identify a location in a directory structure. It is composed by following the directory tree hierarchy in which components, separated by a delimiting character, represent each directory. The delimiting character is most commonly the slash `/`, the backslash character `\`, or colon `:`" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)))

**Absolute Path**
- "An absolute or full path points to the same location in a file system, regardless of the current working directory. To do that, it must include the root directory" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#Absolute_and_relative_paths))

**Relative Path**
- "a relative path starts from some given working directory, avoiding the need to provide the full absolute path" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#Absolute_and_relative_paths))

[Click here](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/computer-interfaces/blob/main/key-terms.md) for a full list of key terms and definitions for this lab.

Before we start moving around, let's use the `pwd` (print working directory` command to show your current location. Type `pwd` in the terminal and press `Enter` or `Return`. Your output might look something like this:
```
/Users/kwalden
```

This directory information is called a `path` (sometimes called a `file path` when dealing with specific files).
- The backslash `/` at the start of the path stands for your computer's `root`
- Subsequent slashes indicate subfolders or subdirectories

So in the `/Users/kwalden` example, the terminal is running in the `kwalden` subfolder which is located in the `Users` folder. The `Users` folder is located at my computer's `root`.

<p align="center"><img align="center" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/computer-interfaces/blob/main/images/Fig_E.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Diagram illustrating computer directory structure"></p>

The inverted tree diagram shown above shows one example of a computer's file system.
- The `root` (top of the tree) is your computer's hard drive.
- The next set of branches are a set of folders (`directories`) that are used by everyone who uses the computer
- The `users` folder includes different specific user profiles
- The folders located under a specific username are associated with that user profile
  * These folders commonly include `Applications`, `Desktop`, `Documents`, `Downloads`, etc.

If you have ever used `File Explorer` (Windows) or `Finder` (Mac), you have navigated this tree structure using the graphical user interface (GUI). Now let's think about how we navigate this structure using the command line interface (CLI).

#### `ls`

Typically by default, your terminal will open in the folder or directory for your user profile.
- But you can check this using the `pwd` (print working directory) command

Let's see what other files and subdirectories are located in your current path by using the list command (`ls`). Type `ls` in the terminal and press `Enter`/`Return`.

<p align="center"><img align="center" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/computer-interfaces/blob/main/images/Fig_F.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Terminal screenshot showing directory contents"></p>

Items that are followed by a file extension (e.g. `.docx`, `.txt`, `.xlsx`, etc) are generally individual files. Items that do not have a file extension are typically subfolders or subdirectories.

#### `cd`

We can move down the tree using the `change directory` command (`cd`). Let's move from your user profile folder to the Desktop.

Type `cd Desktop` and press `Enter`/`Return`.
- You can also type `cd Desk` and press the `Tab` key (before `Enter`/`Return`) to autocomplete the command

When using the `cd` (change directory) command, we are navigating the computer's file system using `relative paths`. This means the location information we are specifying in the terminal is relative to our current position or location in the file system. The previous `cd Desktop` command is an example of a relative path. 

`Absolute paths` always start at the `root` and use backslash `/` symbols to indicate subfolders.
- `/Users/kwalden/Desktop` would be the absolute path version of the previous command
- NOTE: Be sure to replace `kwalden` with your user name

We can use the `ls` command again to see the materials located on our Desktop. We can also move back up the file system tree using the `cd` command.

Instead of using `cd` followed by a relative or absolute path, we can use `cd ..` (`cd` followed by a space and two periods) to move up one level in the tree. Type `cd ..` in the terminal and press `Enter`/`Return`. You can test using `pwd` if needed, but you should be back in the specific user profile folder.
