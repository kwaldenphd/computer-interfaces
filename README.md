## Lab Overview & Goals

This lab covers a variety of topics related to how computers "work." This lab is designed to help you gain an understanding of how the operating system and other software applications interact with the underlying hardware, focusing on common core operating system tasks. Finally, this lab introduces students to the concept of a command-line interface and provides a foundation for navigating the machine using the shell.
