# Key Terms

**Absolute Path**
- "An absolute or full path points to the same location in a file system, regardless of the current working directory. To do that, it must include the root directory" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#Absolute_and_relative_paths))

**Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) & Application Software*
- software that allows the user to interact with the OS

**Command Line Interface (CLI)**
- "A command-line interface (CLI) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor. Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface))

**Computer Terminal**
- "[a] device usually made up of a display unit and a keyboard which allows entry and display of information when on-line to central computer system" ([Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal))

**Device Drivers**
- software that allows the OS to interface with hardware (graphics cards, printers, network adapters, etc.)

**Directory**
- "In computing, a directory is a file system cataloging structure which contains references to other computer files, and possibly other directories. On many computers, directories are known as folders" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)))

**File Extension (or Filename Extension)**
- "A filename extension, file name extension or file extension is a suffix to the name of a computer file (e.g., `.txt`, `.docx`, `.md`). The extension indicates a characteristic of the file contents or its intended use. A filename extension is typically delimited from the rest of the filename with a full stop (period)" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename_extension))

**File Manager (or File Browser)**
- "A file manager or file browser is a computer program that provides a user interface to manage files and folders. The most common operations performed on files or groups of files include creating, opening (e.g. viewing, playing, editing or printing), renaming, copying, moving, deleting and searching for files, as well as modifying file attributes, properties and file permissions. Folders and files may be displayed in a hierarchical tree based on their directory structure" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager))
- Examples: Finder (Mac), File Explorer (Windows)

**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
- "The graphical user interface (GUI) is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces (CLIs), which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface))

**The Kernel**
- core of the OS, controls access to computer hardware, performs scheduling tasks

**Operating System**
- "An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs...For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware...Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer – from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system))

Core OS tasks:
- Process management: allocates resources, executes programs, calls processes
- Memory management: allocates memory, controls memory hardware access
- File system management: interfaces with hardware to transmit, process, and store file system objects
- Device management: oversees system calls for efficient device management

Examples of specific operating systems include:
- Microsoft Windows
- MacOS/iOS
- Linux
- Android
- Chromium

**Path**
- "A path is a string of characters used to uniquely identify a location in a directory structure. It is composed by following the directory tree hierarchy in which components, separated by a delimiting character, represent each directory. The delimiting character is most commonly the slash `/`, the backslash character `\`, or colon `:`" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)))

**Personal Computer**
- "A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose microcomputer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user, rather than by a computer expert or technician" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer))

**Relative Path**
- "a relative path starts from some given working directory, avoiding the need to provide the full absolute path" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#Absolute_and_relative_paths))

**Shell**
- The shell is the user interface for accessing all of the operating system’s services and applications. The shell is the layer of code surrounding the operating system kernel. Your operating system’s shell is the command processor that runs in the CLI (command-line interface) as opposed to the GUI interface that we typically use.

**Unix**
- "a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, whose development started in 1969 at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix))
- [Click here](https://www.opengroup.org/membership/forums/platform/unix) to learn more about Unix and its parent organization, The Open Group.

**Virtual Memory**
- An approach to managing memory that provides "an idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually avaialble on a given machine" (Abhishek Bhattacharjee and Daniel Lustig, *[Architectural and Operating System Support for Virtual Memory](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-01757-5).* Springer, 2017. pp. 1)
